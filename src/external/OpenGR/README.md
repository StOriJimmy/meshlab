# OpenGR
OpenGR is a set C++ libraries for 3D Global Registration.
It is a fork of the [Super4PCS library](https://github.com/nmellado/Super4PCS), and aims at providing several state of the art global registration algorithms for 3d data.
This fork is maintained by the same authors as the Super4PCS library.
