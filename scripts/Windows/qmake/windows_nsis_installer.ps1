# This is a powershell script for computing an installer for MeshLab.
# Requires: 
# - a properly deployed meshlab (see windows_deploy.ps1);
# - the env variable PATH containing the NSIS folder (makensis.exe must be directly accessible)
#
# Without given arguments, the folder that will be deployed is meshlab/distrib.
#
# You can give as argument the DISTRIB_PATH.
#
# After running this script, the installer can be found inside the resources folder.

#saving location where script has been run
